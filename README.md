# Book_Your_Stay

The Resort Booking System is a simple web application created using HTML, CSS, and MySQL to make booking resorts easier. It allows users to search for resorts, check room availability, and book their stay online. The system is user-friendly and works on different devices. MySQL is used to store and manage data like user details, bookings, and resort information. Administrators can manage resorts, rooms, and bookings through a secure admin panel. This project simplifies the booking process for users and helps resort managers organize their services efficiently.
